<h1 align='center'> üß≠Exploring Pythonüêç </h1>

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python tutorials, exercises, and projects, in the form of **Jupyter Notebooks** and **Python scripts**, organized systematically from beginner to advanced levels. It is designed to help learners of all skill levels, from those just starting out to those looking to deepen their understanding of Python and its libraries. The repository is structured into separate folders, each catering to a different proficiency level, as well as an additional folder dedicated to important **Python libraries** that are frequently used.

### üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions

To maintain consistency and improve the readability of files in the repository, I have followed a custom naming convention for all Jupyter notebooks and project files.

|Type of `object`|Naming Convention|
|-|-|
|variable|snake_case|
|boolean|camelCase|
|constant|UPPER_SNAKE_CASE|
|function|verb_like_snake_case|
|class|PascalCase|
